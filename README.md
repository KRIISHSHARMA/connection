# COMPUTATION :
- **HOST** : provides the functionality to start and control vms and containers
- **HYPERVISOR** : a program used to run and manage vms on a computer

        - TYPE 1 : RUNS ON BARE METAL
           - XEN
           - KVM
        - TYPE 2 : RUNS ON HOST OS
           - VMWARE
           - ORACLE
 - **VMs** : is a compute resouce that uses software instead of a physical computer 
- **CONTAINERS**
   1. DOCKER
   2. RKT
   3. LXC
   4. PODMAN

 # NETWORIKNG
 - **OVS**
   - ovs-vswitchd
   - ovsdb-server
 - **LOADBALANCER**
   - LAYER 4 : load balancers act upon data found in network and transport layer protocols (IP, TCP, FTP, UDP).
   - LAYER 7 : load balancers distribute requests based upon data found in application layer protocols such as HTTP.
- **OSI LAYER**
  1. PHYSICAL LAYER
  2. DATA LINK LAYER
  3. NETWORK LAYER
  4. TRANSPORT LAYER
  5. SESSION LAYER
  6. PRESENTATION LAYER
  7. APPLICATION LAYER 
-  **DNS** : turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
-   **IP Addresss**- Internet Protcol (IPv4,IPv6)
 - Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet service provider to the device
 - Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168]
 - Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0]
- **Port No.** - a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.[for http - 80
 - SSH(Secure Shell) - 22
 - SMTP - 25  
 - Telnet - 23
 - https - 443
 - DNS - 53
-  **SSL**- Secure Socket Layer - IP Address + Port Number
# STORAGE :
- **PRIMARY**
  - **RAM**
  - **ROM**
  - **CACHE MEMO**
- **SECONDARY**
  - **HDD**
  - **SDD**
  - **OPTICAL DISK**

# ARCHITECTURE
- **RISC** - Reduced Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - ARM
-  **CISC** - Complex Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - intel, AMD
-  **Von Neumann Architecture**
-  **Hagward Architecture** 
- **ISA** - Instruction Set Architecture - An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done.
